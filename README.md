# KOALA VCBOT
- This bot is for educational purposes only, I do not condone the use of any software that goes against Discord's policies. I love people who star my projects :3

# USAGE
- Coded in Python using [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) (version 1.7.3). You don't need to download them, I have already packed them in /src.
- Refer to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je_GoU6jGF8) video to see it working

# PULL REQUESTS
- Think you can change my code for the better? You're most welcome to do so ⊂(・u・⊂)
